      <h4>Front-end developer from Bulawayo, Zimbabwe</h4>

          My name is Moud Nkazimulo Mpofu, and I was born and raised in
          Bulawayo, Zimbabwe. I moved to Poland, Europe in 2017 to study Civil
          and Environmental Engineering.

          During high school, I participated in chess competitions at the
          national level. Currently, I enjoy painting as a means of unwinding
          and detaching from the outside world. Additionally, I play the guitar.

          Since high school, I have been keen on learning coding and had the
          opportunity to join Zimcode, a program that teaches high scholars in
          Zimbabwe, Bulawayo, to code. During this program, I learned the basics
          of Python and enjoyed building applications using it. Ever since, I
          have been searching for an online program that could provide me with a
          comprehensive understanding of coding, which led me to SheCodes. As an
          online course that teaches coding to women worldwide, my experience
          with SheCodes has been nothing short of amazing so far.
